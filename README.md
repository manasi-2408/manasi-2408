# Hi, I’m Manasi 👋

I work with data to understand how systems perform and how decisions can be improved.
My focus is on analyzing real-world data, identifying patterns, and presenting insights in a way that supports clear business and operational decisions.

I prefer logic over hype, clarity over complexity, and outcomes over opinions.
